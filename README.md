# GAN_model_for_image_reconstruction
GAN model to inpaint corrupted images.  The images had been corrupted with noise and a significant amount of information had been lost. The GAN model was able to make informed predictions about the missing or corrupted pixels in the images,  effectively filling in the gaps and restoring the images to their original quality.
