[Project 1]: Implementation of a machine learning model to inpaint corrupted images.

As part of a project, I successfully implemented a machine learning model to inpaint corrupted images. The images in question had been corrupted with noise and a significant amount of information had been lost, making them difficult to interpret. To address this issue, we used machine learning algorithms to train a model on a dataset of high-quality images, which enabled the model to learn the patterns and features that are typically present in clean images. 
Using this knowledge, the model was able to make informed predictions about the missing or corrupted pixels in the images, effectively filling in the gaps and restoring the images to their original quality. This approach proved effective, and I was able to recover a significant amount of the lost information, enabling us to extract the data we needed from the images. 


[Project 4]: Implementation of a classifier using the Gaussian Kernel method.

In this project, I used a kernel method for classification by finding the optimal decision boundary that can best separate my data points. To achieve this, I utilized the Gaussian kernel function provided to me. This function allowed me to transform my input data points into a higher-dimensional feature space, where the optimal decision boundary was found. The goal was to ultimately create a model that could accurately classify new, unseen data points based on the patterns learned from my training data.

[Project 5]: Clustering, using the K-means algorithm.

A project I worked on involved using the K-means clustering algorithm to group similar data points together based on their features. The goal was to identify patterns or trends within the data that could be used to gain insights and make more informed decisions. The K-means algorithm works by iteratively partitioning the data into K clusters based on their similarity, with each cluster being represented by its centroid. The algorithm then assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and recalculates the centroids based on the new cluster assignments. 
This process continues until the centroids no longer change significantly or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. Overall, the project involved selecting an appropriate value of K, preprocessing the data, running the K-means algorithm, and then analyzing and interpreting the results.

[Project 6]: 3D point classification and feature extraction.

As a student, I had the opportunity to work on a project in the field of 3D Geometry. 
Specifically, I was given a dataset of 3D plane models and was tasked with using machine learning algorithms to classify the points of the model as "wing" or "not wing".
Before performing the classification, I first had to extract relevant features from the points of the models. To do this, I used methods such as Gaussian curvature and normal vector extraction to capture information about the surface geometry of the planes. Next, I sampled the data and interpolated the features in the new points. The sampling method used in this project involved modifying the number of points in the 3D plane models to ensure consistency in the dataset. 
I wanted to either increase or decrease the number of points in the models.  To achieve this, I used a technique called centroidal Voronoi tessellation, which involved finding the centroid of each triangle in the model and creating new triangles with the new points. This method allowed me to control the density of the points in the models, which was important for ensuring the accuracy of our classification model.  Once the new points were added, i interpolated the feature values in these points. With the feature extraction and data pre-processing complete, I then used machine learning algorithms to train a model to classify the points as either "wing" or "not wing".  The model was trained using labeled examples of points and their corresponding classifications. Overall, this project allowed me to gain valuable experience in using machine learning for classification tasks and in feature extraction from 3D data.  It was a challenging but rewarding experience that helped me further develop my skills in data analysis and problem solving.

[Project 7]: Graphics using OpenGL library in C++ language.

In a C++ programming environment, I worked on a project utilizing the OpenGL library. 
My objective was to create portals that would allow the user to seamlessly transition from one room to another. 
While OpenGL is not as commonly used today, this project allowed me to gain valuable knowledge about graphics pipelines and how they function. 
By implementing this project, I was able to develop my skills in 3D modeling, lighting, and shading. 
It also gave me a deeper understanding of how to optimize graphics for real-time applications. 
Overall, this project was a great learning experience and helped me to build a strong foundation in computer graphics.
